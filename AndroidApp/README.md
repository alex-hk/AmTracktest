# Android Application

This application will be responsible for recieving data from the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth using packets.
The said packets will contain information of the equipment such as longitude, latitude, and the speed. From
here we can send the packets into more usable data to the server which will then repeat the process to read more
information from the Raspberry Pi.
