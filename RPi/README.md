# Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi will have a GPS module connected to it which reads signals of where and how fast the equipment is.
Also, the Raspberry Pi will act as a bluetooth server to be able to send the data to the Android device as packets.
This should be a constant stream, and the server will always be on for the client (Android) to be able to connect to.
